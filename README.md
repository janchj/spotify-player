# spotify-player

// next:
Use a react application to connect to the office account (at the moment mine, change that!) and serve as a player.
After that, build/configure a "bot" on slack to allow members to:
- vote/downvote on songs (and rank them to have better playlist)
- add songs
- remove songs (only if # people approve)
// TO DO: scope more stories
